# Vueez

Vueez is a minimalistic tool for building and serving Vue applications. It is designed with simplicity in mind, running
on vanilla Node.js and maintaining a very low dependency profile. In fact, it has only three dependencies: Vue,
TypeScript, and esbuild. Vueez itself is intended to be a development dependency and will build a self-sufficient
package. An app built with Vueez does not even require Vue in production.

### Features

Vueez supports:

- Vue apps written in TypeScript
- Single File Components (SFCs)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

In development mode, Vueez can watch, rebuild, and reload server components, though it does not support hot reloading
client-side components and likely never will.

### Why use Vueez? Why is it better than established tools like Vite or Nuxt?

It's not. Vite and Nuxt are better in almost every aspect, especially in terms of completeness and reliability. If
you're satisfied with them, there's no reason to switch to Vueez.

Vueez fills a small niche for religious zero-dependency folks, who want to have full control over their apps and
appreciate lightning fast build times. If you are somewhat embarassed by heavy scaffolded projects, would rather spend
extra time coding than troubleshooting third-party tools that donâ€™t work as expected, then Vueez might be worth a look.

## Installation

You can install Vueez using npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vueez
```

## Building a Vue App

To build your first Vue application, create a `build.mjs` script in the root of your project with the following content:

```javascript
import { build } from 'vueez';

build({
	devMode: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
	clientOptions: {
		entryPoints: ['src/client/index.ts'],
		outfile: 'build/client/client.js'
	}
});
```

Then, run the script with `node build.mjs`, and your client app will be ready for deployment.

Vueez does not have a configuration file or a command-line tool. These are the kinds of additional functionalities that
simply don't fit the minimalistic concept of Vueez.
